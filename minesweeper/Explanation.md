# Explanation of Implementation

The core idea behind this code is to let the AI reason about the Minesweeper board using logical sentences. 
The two key classes here are the **Sentence** class and the **MinesweeperAI** class. 

The Sentence class is designed to capture a statement like “Out of these cells, exactly N of them are mines.” Meanwhile, the MinesweeperAI class uses these sentences to decide which moves are safe and which cells are definitely mines.

## Sentence Class
Let’s start with the Sentence class. When you create a Sentence, you pass it a set of cells along with a count that indicates how many of those cells are mines. For example, if you have a sentence like:

```python
sentence = Sentence({(1, 2), (1, 3)}, 2)
```
this tells the AI that both cells (1, 2) and (1, 3) must be mines. 

The method known_mines checks if the number of cells in the sentence is exactly equal to the count. If it is, then every cell in that set is a mine. The code looks like this:

```python
def known_mines(self):
    if len(self.cells) == self.count:
        return copy.deepcopy(self.cells)
    return None 
```

In the example above, since there are two cells and the count is 2, known_mines would return a copy of the set {(1, 2), (1, 3)}.

Similarly, the known_safes method determines if all cells in the sentence are safe. This is the case when the count is 0. For instance, if a sentence is created like this:

```python
sentence = Sentence({(2, 2), (2, 3)}, 0)
```
it means neither (2, 2) nor (2, 3) is a mine, so known_safes will return both cells. The implementation is:

```python
def known_safes(self):
    if self.count == 0:
        return copy.deepcopy(self.cells)
    return None
 ```
The methods **mark_mine** and **mark_safe** are used to update the sentence when the AI discovers that a particular cell is a mine or is safe. For example, if a cell is determined to be a mine, the mark_mine method removes it from the set and decreases the count:

```python
def mark_mine(self, cell):
    if cell in self.cells:
        self.cells.discard(cell)
        self.count -= 1
```
This keeps the sentence logically consistent. If a cell is already known to be safe, mark_safe simply removes it from the set without affecting the count:

```python
def mark_safe(self, cell):
    if cell in self.cells:
        self.cells.discard(cell)
```

## MinesweeperAI Class
Now, let’s talk about the MinesweeperAI class. This class is responsible for tracking the moves that have been made, the cells that are known to be safe, and the cells that have been identified as mines. It also keeps a knowledge base of Sentence objects that represent the current state of the board.

When the AI makes a move, it calls the **add_knowledge** method. This method begins by marking the cell as a move that has been made and marking it as safe. It then examines the neighboring cells. The AI first checks all the neighbors around the chosen cell and constructs a list of those cells that have not yet been identified as safe or as mines. At the same time, it adjusts the count of mines if some neighbors have already been determined to be mines. For example, if a safe cell (3, 3) is revealed with a count of 2 and one of its neighbors is already known to be a mine, the count for the new sentence is reduced by one.

Here’s a snippet showing how the neighboring cells are processed:

```python
neighbor_cells = []
x, y = cell
for i in range(x - 1, x + 2):
    for j in range(y - 1, y + 2):
        if self.illegal_coordinate(i, j) or (i, j) == cell:
            continue
        if (i, j) in self.safes:
            continue
        if (i, j) in self.mines:
            adjusted_count -= 1
            continue
        neighbor_cells.append((i, j))
```        
After collecting the undetermined neighbor cells, a new Sentence is added to the AI’s knowledge base, which then becomes a basis for further deductions.

Once the new sentence is added, the AI looks at all its knowledge to see if it can mark any additional cells as safe or as mines. For each sentence, if the number of cells equals the mine count, then every cell in that sentence is a mine; if the count is zero, then every cell is safe. The AI also infers new sentences by comparing existing ones. If one sentence’s cells are a subset of another’s, it creates a new sentence representing the difference. This kind of logical inference is crucial because it allows the AI to deduce information that isn’t directly given by the game.

The AI also has methods for choosing moves. The make_safe_move method simply goes through the set of safe cells and returns one that hasn’t been played yet. For example:

```python
def make_safe_move(self):
    for move in self.safes:
        if move not in self.moves_made:
            return move
    return None
```
If no safe moves are available, the AI resorts to make_random_move, which scans the board for a cell that has not been chosen and isn’t known to be a mine. Although the specification calls for a random move, the implementation here returns the first eligible move it finds:

```python
def make_random_move(self):
    for i in range(0, self.height):
        for j in range(0, self.width):
            if (i, j) not in self.moves_made and (i, j) not in self.mines:
                return (i, j)
    return None
```

## Conclusion 
In summary, the Minesweeper AI works by continuously updating its knowledge base as it learns more about the board. Each new safe cell adds a sentence that encapsulates information about its neighboring cells, and the AI uses logical deductions to mark additional cells as safe or as mines. The interplay between updating sentences and inferring new sentences is what allows the AI to make increasingly informed moves, thereby simulating human-like reasoning on the Minesweeper board.
