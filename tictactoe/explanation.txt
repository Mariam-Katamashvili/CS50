initial_state method defines tictactoe board before the game start - empty.

player function needs to find whos turn it is. It is done by checking if the amount of x and o are equal. If so, then return x, if not return o.

actions returns all possible cells where move can be made - it returns empty cells

result simply adds the action to the board by first copying it and placing action on the i,j cell

winner checks if there are same symbols on lines. It is achieved by simply checking 0,i 1,i 2,i; i,0 i,1 i,2 and diagonals.

terminal function checks if there is no winner and no cell is empty. If no cell is empty it means that game is draw.

utility function simply checks who won the game and assigns 1 0 or -1. This is necessary for minimax algorithm.

minimax function is the most important part of this code. This algorithm decides what is the best move by recursively checking all possible solutions and finding the most optimal one.
if the player is X then it is looking for maximal value to be its outcome since winning value of X is 1.
X tries to find the maximal value from all actions based on what O would choose.
It recursively calls min_value function which then calls max_value function because both of players think that the other one will play optimally.
The same is done for O. If the computer is O then It want to find the minimum possible value, so it tries to find the minimum among maximums.
