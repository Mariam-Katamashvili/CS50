# Explanation of the Code

The `initial_state` function defines the Tic Tac Toe board before the game starts. It returns a 3x3 board represented as a list of three lists, where each cell is initialized to `EMPTY` (which is defined as `None`). This means that when the game begins, the board is completely empty.

The `player` function determines whose turn it is by counting the number of `X`s and `O`s on the board. It sums the counts for each row and compares them; if the counts are equal, then it is `X`’s turn (since `X` always goes first), otherwise it is `O`’s turn.

The `actions` function returns all possible moves available on the board. It examines every cell in the 3x3 grid and returns a set of tuples `(i, j)` representing the coordinates of each cell that is still empty. In other words, the only moves available are those where no mark has been placed yet.

The `result` function creates a new board state that results from making a move. It takes the current board and an action (a tuple specifying the row and column) as inputs. First, it checks that the action is valid by confirming it is among the available actions. It then creates a deep copy of the board so that the original board remains unchanged and updates the copied board by placing the symbol of the current player in the specified cell `(i, j)`. The new board state is returned after the move is made.

The `winner` function checks if there is a winning configuration on the board. It looks for three of the same symbols in any row, any column, or along either diagonal. For instance, it checks if all cells in any row (such as positions `(0, 0)`, `(0, 1)`, and `(0, 2)`) or any column (such as `(0, 0)`, `(1, 0)`, and `(2, 0)`) are the same and not empty. It also checks both diagonals. If a winning condition is met, it returns the winning symbol (`X` or `O`); otherwise, it returns `None`.

The `terminal` function determines whether the game has ended. It does this by checking if there is a winner or if every cell on the board is filled (which would indicate a tie). If either condition is met, the function returns `True`, signaling that the game is over; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The `utility` function assigns a numerical value to the outcome of a terminal board. If `X` has won, it returns `1`; if `O` has won, it returns `-1`; and if the game ended in a tie, it returns `0`. These numerical values are critical for the minimax algorithm to evaluate the desirability of each board state.

The `minimax` function is the most important part of this code. It decides the best move by recursively exploring all possible moves and their consequences, assuming that both players play optimally. The algorithm uses two helper functions: `max_value` and `min_value`. When it is `X`’s turn, the algorithm seeks to maximize the outcome (because a win for `X` is worth `1`), and it uses `min_value` to simulate the opponent’s best response. Conversely, when it is `O`’s turn, the algorithm seeks to minimize the outcome (since a win for `O` is represented as `-1`), and it uses `max_value` to simulate the opponent’s moves. The function iterates over all possible actions, evaluates the resulting board states, and selects the action that leads to the optimal outcome for the current player.

Below is a key snippet of the `minimax` function that demonstrates this recursive decision-making process:


```python
def minimax(board):
    if terminal(board):
        return None

    current_player = player(board)

    def max_value(board):
        if terminal(board):
            return utility(board)
        v = -math.inf
        for action in actions(board):
            v = max(v, min_value(result(board, action)))
        return v

    def min_value(board):
        if terminal(board):
            return utility(board)
        v = math.inf
        for action in actions(board):
            v = min(v, max_value(result(board, action)))
        return v

    best_action = None

    if current_player == X:
        best_value = -math.inf
        for action in actions(board):
            action_value = min_value(result(board, action))
            if action_value > best_value:
                best_value = action_value
                best_action = action
    else:
        best_value = math.inf
        for action in actions(board):
            action_value = max_value(result(board, action))
            if action_value < best_value:
                best_value = action_value
                best_action = action

    return best_action
   ```
In this snippet, the function first checks if the board is terminal, in which case it returns None because no moves can be made. It then determines the current player and, based on whose turn it is, chooses the move that either maximizes or minimizes the outcome. The recursive calls between max_value and min_value ensure that the algorithm considers all possible counter-moves, thereby simulating perfect play from both players.

Overall, this code sets up a complete Tic Tac Toe game with an AI that uses the minimax algorithm to choose optimal moves. The functions work together to represent the game state, determine legal moves, simulate the consequences of actions, and ultimately decide the best move to play.
