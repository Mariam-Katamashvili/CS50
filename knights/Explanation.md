# Explanation of the Implementation

## Overview
This document explains the logical structure behind solving the Knights and Knaves puzzles using propositional logic. Each puzzle consists of characters who are either knights (always tell the truth) or knaves (always lie). The goal is to determine the status of each character based on their statements.

## Logical Setup
For each puzzle, we define propositional symbols:
- `AKnight`: A is a knight
- `AKnave`: A is a knave
- `BKnight`: B is a knight
- `BKnave`: B is a knave
- `CKnight`: C is a knight
- `CKnave`: C is a knave

Each character must be either a knight or a knave but not both, which is expressed as:
```python
And(Or(AKnight, AKnave), Not(And(AKnight, AKnave)))
```
This ensures that a character is exclusively one type.

## Puzzle 0
**Statement:** A says "I am both a knight and a knave."

**Logical Representation:**
```python
knowledge0 = And(
    And(Or(AKnight, AKnave), Not(And(AKnight, AKnave))),
    Implication(AKnight, And(AKnight, AKnave))
)
```
- If A were a knight, their statement would be true, meaning A is both a knight and a knave, which is impossible.
- This contradiction means A must be a knave.

## Puzzle 1
**Statements:**
- A says "We are both knaves."
- B says nothing.

**Logical Representation:**
```python
knowledge1 = And(
    And(Or(AKnight, AKnave), Not(And(AKnight, AKnave))),
    And(Or(BKnight, BKnave), Not(And(BKnight, BKnave))),
    Biconditional(AKnight, And(AKnave, BKnave))
)
```
- If A were a knight, their statement must be true, meaning A is a knave (contradiction).
- Therefore, A must be a knave.
- Since A is a knave, their statement is false, meaning "We are both knaves" is false, implying B must be a knight.

## Puzzle 2
**Statements:**
- A says "We are the same kind."
- B says "We are of different kinds."

**Logical Representation:**
```python
knowledge2 = And(
    And(Or(AKnight, AKnave), Not(And(AKnight, AKnave))),
    And(Or(BKnight, BKnave), Not(And(BKnight, BKnave))),
    Biconditional(AKnight, Or(And(AKnight, BKnight), And(AKnave, BKnave))),
    Biconditional(BKnight, Or(And(AKnave, BKnight), And(AKnight, BKnave)))
)
```
- A says, **"We are the same kind."**  
  - If A is a knight, the statement must be true, meaning A and B are either both knights or both knaves.  
  - If A is a knave, the statement must be false, meaning A and B are of different kinds (one is a knight, and the other is a knave).  
- B says, **"We are of different kinds."**  
  - If B is a knight, the statement must be true, meaning A and B must be different.  
  - If B is a knave, the statement must be false, meaning A and B must be the same.  

From these statements, we derive the following:  
- The logical statement `Biconditional(AKnight, Or(And(AKnight, BKnight), And(AKnave, BKnave)))` is enough to deduce that **B is a knight** (since it aligns with the truth condition).  
- Since B is a knight, B's statement must be true: A and B are of different kinds.  
- This means **A must be a knave**.  

 
## Puzzle 3
**Statements:**
- A says either "I am a knight." or "I am a knave." (unknown which)
- B says "A said 'I am a knave.'"
- B says "C is a knave."
- C says "A is a knight."

**Logical Representation:**
```python
knowledge3 = And(
    And(Or(AKnight, AKnave), Not(And(AKnight, AKnave))),
    And(Or(BKnight, BKnave), Not(And(BKnight, BKnave))),
    And(Or(CKnight, CKnave), Not(And(CKnight, CKnave))),
    Biconditional(AKnight, Or(AKnight, AKnave)),
    Biconditional(BKnight, AKnave),
    Biconditional(BKnight, CKnave),
    Biconditional(CKnight, AKnight)
)
```
- A says either **"I am a knight."** or **"I am a knave."**, but we don’t know which.  
  - Regardless of what A said, a knight's statement is true, and a knave's statement is false.  
  - This doesn't immediately help us determine A's status.  
- B says **"A said ‘I am a knave.’"**  
  - If B is a knight, then A really did say "I am a knave," meaning A is a knave.  
  - If B is a knave, then B is lying, meaning A did not say "I am a knave" (which doesn't immediately determine A's identity).  
- B also says **"C is a knave."**  
  - If B is a knight, this must be true, so C is a knave.  
  - If B is a knave, then this statement is false, meaning C is actually a knight.  
- C says **"A is a knight."**  
  - If C is a knight, this statement must be true, meaning A is a knight.  
  - If C is a knave, this statement must be false, meaning A is a knave.  

From these statements, we derive the following:  
- `Biconditional(BKnight, AKnave)`: If B is a knight, then A must be a knave.  
- `Biconditional(BKnight, CKnave)`: If B is a knight, then C must be a knave.  
- `Biconditional(CKnight, AKnight)`: If C is a knight, then A must be a knight.  

By evaluating these, we find that **B is a knave, C is a knight, and A is a knight**.
